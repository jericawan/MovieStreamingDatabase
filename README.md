# Movie Streaming App

A full-stack web app for managing a movie streaming service database. Built for my database systems course project.

## What It Does

This app lets you browse movies, rate them, track what you've watched, and manage user accounts with different subscription levels. Admins can add movies, actors, and studios through a dashboard.

## Built With

**Backend:** Java + Spring Boot + MySQL  
**Frontend:** Just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks!)

## Running the App

You'll need Java 17+, MySQL, and Maven installed.

### Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a MySQL database called `moviestream_db`
3. Update your database credentials in `src/main/resources/application.properties`
4. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
5. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser, or run a local server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   python3 -m http.server 3000
   ```

### Test Account

Log in as admin to access the full dashboard:
- Email: `admin@admin.com`
- Password: `admin123`

## How It Works

The app has two main parts:

**Backend (Spring Boot REST API)**
- Handles all the database operations
- Enforces user permissions (admins vs regular users)
- Auto-generates movie codes, actor codes, etc. using MySQL triggers

**Frontend (Single Page App)**
- Profile selection screen for users with multiple profiles
- Movie browsing with studio names and watch progress
- Rating system where you can review movies
- Settings page for changing passwords and subscription plans
- Admin panel for managing movies, actors, and studios

## Database

The database has tables for accounts, profiles, movies, actors, ratings, watch history, studios, and subscription plans. I wrote triggers to:
- Generate unique codes automatically
- Prevent users from exceeding their profile limit
- Make sure ratings are between 1-5
- Stop duplicate ratings on the same movie

## Notes

- Passwords aren't hashed (this is just a school project!)
- The frontend doesn't use any frameworks - just vanilla JS
- Movie/actor codes are auto-generated by database triggers
- Regular users can only edit their own ratings and profiles
- Admins can do pretty much everything
